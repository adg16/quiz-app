      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "correctAnswerExplanation": "Solve by using the equation to get the sum of interior angles. <br><b>(n-2)180=540</b><br> Multiply (n-2) and 180 with the distribution property. <br> <b>180n-360 = 540</b> <br> Apply addition property of equality/transpose. <br> <b>180n - 360 + 360 = 540 + 360</b> <br> <b>180n = 900</b> <br> Divide both sides by 180 to get the value of n. <br> <b>180n/180=900/180</b> <br> <b>n=5</b> <br> Meaning, the polygon has 5 sides and therefore it is a pentagon!",

      "correctAnswer": "d",
      "correctAnswerExplanation": "In finding out the measure of each interior angle we will use the formula <b>(n-2)180/n</b> <br> <b>n=8</b>, therefore <b>(8-2)180/8= (6)180/8= 1,080/8=135</b>, so the answer will be <b>135 degrees</b>.",

      "image": "/images/quiz/quiz1_q3_question.jpg",
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "correctAnswerExplanation": "We know that the area of a triangle is <b>½(base x height). ½(bh) = area</b>. So if we substitute the given values: <br> <b>½(base x 4) = 20.</b> <br> Multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to remove ½ <br> <b>2 (½(b x 4) = 2 (20)</b> <br> <b>4b = 40</b> <br> Now, we divide both sides by 4 to get the base's value <br> <b>4b/4 = 40/4</b> <br> <b>b = 10</b> <br> Therefore, the <b>base of the bush should be 10</b>.",
